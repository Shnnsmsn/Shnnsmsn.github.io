	<li> GO SEE THE TAOIST TEMPLE IN CEBU</li>

Based on the writings of Lao Tzu, this religion follows “Living according to the way” focusing on humility and piety.

This sanctuary now stands as the Cebu Taoist Temple, the pagoda shrine that has become one of the island’s biggest tourist attractions.</font> </p>
